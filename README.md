## Machine-Hack-Countries-Financial-Strength

Based on Country's trade with each other - Predict particular country's financial strength.  


Approach taken to Predict Country's Financial Strength Model :

*Removed missing data from the dataset
*Check the correlation 
*Exploratory Data Analysis
*Check on Outliers and Skewness 
*NOrmilization of Data 

*Applied Linear Regression Model [Model gives very low R-squared 0.02 - due to low correaltion]
*Applied Regression Tree Model - R-squared around 0.80 
*Applied model on test dataset and poredicted 'Balance' variable
*Also, applied model on train dataset - plot graph for actual Balance and predicted Balance variable.
